# Input for cmake to create the package configuration file: ccdbConfig.cmake
# for find_package()
#
# Note: This sets up a Modern CMake package which puts all the information
# in a *target*.
# To build against this, you only need to do "find_package(ccdb REQUIRED)"
# and then "target_link_libraries(mytarg PUBLIC ccdb)"
# This will link against the library and it will *also*
# include the includes directories automatically.
