One must have CCDB_HOME variable pointitng to the root of CCDB package. 
You can run script located at root of CCDB:

##RUN CODE:

     source environment.bash

The script will determine it's path and set all needed directories to run and link ccdb.

Or you can add next lines to your .bashrc

##CODE FOR .bashrc:

    #set CCDB environment
    export CCDB_HOME=/path/to/ccdb/home/directory

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CCDB_HOME/lib":$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PYTHONPATH="$CCDB_HOME/python":"$CCDB_HOME/python/ccdb/ccdb_pyllapi/":$PYTHONPATH
    export PATH="$CCDB_HOME/bin":$

 make ccdb library for your system. 
 scons            - makes ccdb library located $CCDB_HOME/lib and test executable located in $CCDB_HOME/bin


##RUN CODE:

    cd $CCDB_HOME
    scons

 If You would like to install database on the local machine, you need to create
 a database (by default it is ment to be called ccdb). 
 mysql script $CCDB_HOME/mysql/ccdb.mysql.sql generates schema for you. 
 MySQL-Workbench project with mysql schema is located in the same directory. 

##RUN CODE:

      mysql -u root -p <$CCDB_HOME/mysql/ccdb.mysql.sql

 Database ccdb will be created and filled with tables and default records.
 
 HallD constants are stored in halld-<MM-DD-YYY>.mysql.sql file. To fill the 
 database with the latest Hall D constants:

 ##RUN CODE:

      mysql -u root -p ccdb <$CCDB_HOME/mysql/halld-11-09-2011.mysql.sql
 
 By default CCDB tries to connect by using 'ccdb_user' user name with no password 
 So You might whant to create such user or specify connection string explicitly later

 To create the user for development purposes use sql command like this

##RUN CODE:

     mysql -u root -p 
     CREATE USER ccdb_user;
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ccdb.* TO 'ccdb_user'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
     exit;


  Adjust mysql configuration *max_allowed_packet* for bigger value i.e 32M in order
  to be able to get large data tables from the CCDB


##RUN CODE:
 
     sudo echo max_allowed_packet=32M >> /etc/my.cnf 
	 
 (If you encounter an error "Found option without preceding group in config file: /etc/my.cnf" while running mysql after that, 
 open file /etc/my.cnf with editor and add [mysqld] before max_allowed_packet)

=====================================
 
 In order to log changes it is HIGHLY desirable to let CCDB know yout CUE user
 name. If your CUE user is not the same as $USER variable, please define
 CCDB_USER environment variable as your CUE username.
 
##INCERT INTO .bashrc:
 
     export CCDB_USER=<your CUE login>

 To test the CCDB installed correctly you might go to $CCDB_HOME/bin directory and run ./test 

##RUN CODE:

     cd $CCDB_HOME/bin
     ./tests_ccdb

You should see ccdb unit test running and successfully complete.


To test python is working you may run ccdbcmd 

#RUN CODE:

     ccdbcmd -i

interactive ccdb shell should be started

This manual was tested on Fedora 14, Fedora 15, RHEL 6

##RUN CODE:

     yum install scons mysql-server mysql-devel python-devel

If you haven't configured mysql server:

##RUN CODE:

     service mysqld start
     mysqladmin -u root -h password 'your-password'
