GENERAL
=======
This manual will help you to use Visual Studio 2010 to develop CCDB package. It is EASY to do this on Windows, and the only requirment to install some additional FREE tools and setup some variables. 



1. INSTALL TOOLS
================
We assume that you use VS2010 for development. VS2010 C++ Express is free. Our recomendation is to use VS2010 pro + Whole Tomato Visual Assist X, you can try both for 60 days for free and then decide. VS2010 C++ Express + Visual Assist X will work too. JUST TRY IT. [VS2010 compare](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/product-comparison#expressCompareTable) here is detailed comparision of different Visual Studio versions with links to download. Configuring other IDEs on Windows would be merelly the same. 

So... You have to install next software (all is free and mostly open source). Choose x86 versions for now:

*  [Python 2.7 x86](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi)
*  [pyreadline for windows](https://launchpad.net/pyreadline/+download)
*  [MySQL-python-1.2.3.win32-py2.7] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python/files/latest/download)
*  [Python tools for VS2010](http://pytools.codeplex.com/releases) - to open VS2010 python project
*  [MySQL community server](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
*  [MySQL Connector C x86](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/c/)
*  [MySQL workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) this is optional but very helpfull tool
*  [tortoise svn](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html) - dont reboot as it asks. Reboot in the end.

(!) It is relevant to install x86 versions of the packages


2. GET SOURCES
==============
To use tortoise svn click right button on a folder you would like CCDB to be checked out in, choose "SVN Checkout" in the context menu. 

Ccdb trunk is 
https://phys12svn.jlab.org/repos/trunk/ccdb



3. ENVIRONMENT
==============

3 environment variables must be set in order to compile swig with VS2010. Swig and Python should be in PATH variable.
It is optional to include MySQL connector incluydto the path too.

CCDB_HOME - pointing to the ccdb root directory. (directory containing this file and folders: bin, lib, src, etc.)
PYTHON_INCLUDE - the directory that contains python.h
PYTHON_LIB - the python library including path for linking

Start -> Edit environment variables for your account *-> Set there:  

     ++------------------++----------------------------------------------------------
     ||                  ||
     ||     NAME         ||     VALUE      
     ++------------------++----------------------------------------------------------
     ||                  ||
     || CCDB_HOME        ||  C:\Your\Path\To\CCDB\home     
     ||                  ||
     || PATH             ||  C:\Swig;   C:\Python27;
     ||                  ||
     || PYTHON_INCLUDE   ||  C:\Python27\include
     ||                  ||
     || PYTHON_LIB       ||  c:\Python27\python27.lib
     ||                  ||
     || MYSQL_CONNECTOR  ||  C:\Program Files (x86)\MySQL\MySQL Connector C 6.0.2\
     ||                  ||
     ++------------------++----------------------------------------------------------

(!) Dont forget to change this directories to yours! =)

* - just press 'start' and put 'environ' in the search bar

Tortoise svn asks to reboot. Thus reboot would do. 

(***) One optional environment is JANA_HOME, VS2010 Jana project use it for autocomplition of Jana classes
No any other goal for this variable. One is free to set it or not



4. MySQL
========

Run mysql-workbench. 
The workbench project is located in %CCDB_HOME\mysql
in mysqlworkbench press 



5. VS2010 PROJECT AND TEST
==========================

The VS2010 project is located in:

%CCDB_HOME%\projects\VisualStudio\CCDB.sln

4.1) Directories of mysql connector are "entered directly" in VS2010 projects. Check that properties: 

Configuration properties->C/C++->Additional include directories
Configuration properties->Librarian->Additional Library directories

for projects CCDBLibrary, CCDBTests, PythonWrapping pointing to a real directory


4.2) Your enviroment is stored in CCDB.suo file wich is not included in the svn (it is Your enviroment), so you may have to:
a) In the Solution Explorer (place where files are listed)
b) click right mouse button on CCDBTests project
c) click "Set as SturtUp Project"


press ctrl+F5 to run the project.
