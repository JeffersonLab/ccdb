ccdbcmd could be use as interactive shell or just like command shell tool. 

Usage from command line is:
   
     ccdbcmd <ccdb arguents> command <command arguments>

Usage as interactive shell:
    
     ccdbcmd <ccdb arguments> -i 
     > command1 
     > command2 
     > ...
     > q 



### Example 1. Command line:

                (1)                           (2)  (3)
      ccdbcmd -c "mysql://john@localhost:999" ls /TOF/params

1. *-c* "mysql://john@localhost" - sets the ccdb connection string. 
   If no *-c*  flag is given, ccdb will try CCDB_CONNECTION environment 
   variable, then use default connection string. The connection strings are 
   described in a next chapter []. 

2. *ls* - is a ccdb command which returns a list of directories and tables
     that belongs to parent directory /TOF/params

3  */TOF/params* is the argument of ls command. All is like in posix shell.


### Example 2. Interactive:
 
      ccdbcmd -c "mysql://john@localhost:999" -i               (1)
      > ls /TOF/params                                         (2)
      > help                                                   (3)
      > cd /TOF                                                (4)
      > cd params
      > ls
      > pwd                                                    (5)                                              
      > q                                                      (6)

1. flag '-i'  will start ccdbcmd in interactive mode. 

2. 'ls /TOF/params' - the result is exactly the same as in Example 1. 
    One stays in the interactive shell after the execution.

3. 'help' command provides what commands are ready to use and how to use them

4. executing next commands will reproduce Example 1 once more. 

5. ccdbcmd interactive mode have the concept of a current working directory,
   with relative and absolute pathes. *pwd* command will show the current
   working directory.    


6. to exit interactive mode enter 'q', 'quit' or press ^D


Since ccdb objects have /name/paths and many other things that looks like 
POSIX file system, the commands are very posix-shell-like. 


CONNECTION
==========
<a id="ch_connection">


CCDB uses the connection strings to specify a data source. 
The connection string is a string in a form of:
<protocol>://<protocol specified format>

*MySQL connection string:*

>  mysql://<username>:<password>@<server_address>:<port> <database>

One may ommit any part except "mysql://<server_address>". The default values
will be used:

CCDB connection defaults:
* username - ccdb_user
* password - no password
* port - default MySQL port (now is 3306)
* database - ccdb


How ccdbcmd gets the connection string:

1. The default connection string is  **"mysql://ccdb_user@localhost ccdb"** 
   (as mentioned before) 

2. if CCDB_CONNECTION environment variable is set it is used overwriting 
   the default connection string.

3. if -c or --connection flag followed connection string is set it is used
   overwriting all other


### Example 3. Connection string 1:

        "mysql://john@localhost:999"

This is the connection string from Example 1. It tells ccdbcmd to connect to:
 *  MySQL server on 'localhost' using port 999
 *  user is 'john' with no password
 *  the database is 'ccdb' by default


### Example 4. Simple connection string:
	
	"mysql://localhost"

 * MySQL server on localhost using port 3306 (default)
 * user is 'ccdb_user' with no password (default)
 * the database is 'ccdb' (default)


### Example 5. Full connection string:

        "mysql://smith:hHjD83f@192.168.1.3:4444 ccdb_database"

It tells ccdbcmd to connect to:
 * MySQL server  on '192.168.1.3' using port 4444 
 * user is 'smith' with password 'hHjD83f'
 * the database is 'ccdb_database'

     


HELP SYSTEM 
===========
<a id="ch_help">

ccdbcmd is designed to be a self descriptive. By using 'help' 'usage' and 'example' commands 
one could get all the commands and how to use them. 

By using 'howto' command one could get tutorials for typical situations.
