This manual asserts that ccdb is set and database is configured

Installing ccdb web interface (web site) consists of 3 steps:
1. Copy files to right site folders
2. Edit configuration file
3. Fill in your content


S T E P   1   -  C O P Y   S I T E
==================================

CCDB Web site uses python cgi scripts to access CCDB database and to generate html response. 
These scripts and html templates should be installed in cgi-bin folder of the server. 

When html is returned from the server it looks for additional content, like button pictures,
styling information and java script. All pictures, css, js files should be installed in 
regular www folder of the server. 

Thus ccdb has two folders:
$CCDB_HOME/web/cgi-bin
$CCDB_HOME/web/www

(One could configure server to run cgi in www folder and copy all contents of ccdb to the only folder. It is an option)

##RUN CODE:

    cp -r $CCDB_HOME/web/cgi-bin/* /Your/server/cgi-bin forlder. 
    cp -r $CCDB_HOME/web/www/*     /Your/server/www folder



S T E P   2  -  C O N F I G U R E
=================================

The main configuration file for CCDB web site is cgi-bin/ccdb_web_config.py

Fields of the file have description in comments. Please, review them all, because all of them are relevant for CCDB site to be run.



S T E P   3  -  C O N T E N T
=============================

1. www/index.php file is the only content file in www directory. It serves to redirect from 
   main page of the site to the cgi-bin/objects page. Edit file to set proper redirection
   or delete file at all

2. cgi-bin/templates/doc.html - contains content of the Documentation page. Most probably
   one would like to set own links and text there. 

3. cgi-bin/templates/master.html - contains main html content for all pages. Edit the page
   to add links to top menu (for example) or footer text.
